This is my First JavaScript Quiz App, there is a Welcome screen upon loading which gives you information about how to pass the 10 questions test.
I found this cool Wizard GIF which is putting magic spell onto the start button when you click it the Test App will load.
Everytime you refresh the page the app will begin with random sets of questions, I didn't put the timer to take the test which will be my next enhancement.

*************************************************Detail Information ***********************************************************************************

The App was built using some Bootstrap and lots of CSS feature.
It has several functions, some event listeners, random number generator, record, and status variables.
1. The first event is click, it hides the welcome screen and the test app loads to the screen.
2. The app loads a random question from local storage, the user select the answer choice and the button will change it color also
there is tracker which has orange color to show the current question the user is on.
3. If the user answer is wrong then the tracker will change to red color and correct answer will turn it green.
4. The user must select an option or alert message will pop up and the test won't progress further.
5. Once you are on question 10, the next question button changes to submit test which will show the user result with pass or fail status.
6. After the result, the user has an option to retake the test to improve his knowledge and skills.
7. The app only has 10 Questions, I'm planning to add some more questions to make it little more challenging and the timer feature will be added also.
8. The one important feature is the user won't be able to copy and paste the questions.
9. The app was fun to build, I also used query media so the app works on laptop screen as well.
10. I hope you enjoyed the app.
